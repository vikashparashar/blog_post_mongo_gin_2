# The task at hand is to create a blog application API using the Gin web framework (https://gin-gonic.com/) and golang mongo driver (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/) as the database.

## The project requirements are as follows:

1. Implement CRUD APIs for the blog feature, including creating a new blog post, reading a single blog post, reading all blog posts, updating a blog post, and deleting a blog post.
2. Implement an authentication system to restrict the ability to create, update, and delete blog posts to only users with admin privileges. 
3. Only admins should be able to create, update, and delete blog posts, while regular users should only be able to view them.
4. Create admin user credentials to seed the database during initialization, rather than through a signup process.
5. Adhere to best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code, including proper use of Go's concurrency features and error handling.
6. Ensure that the code is well-structured, maintainable, easy to understand, and properly documented where necessary.



####  This code defines a `Blog` struct with fields for the blog's title, content, and creation date. The `main` function sets up a connection to the MongoDB database and defines routes for handling CRUD operations on blog posts.

#### The `getBlogs` function retrieves all blog posts from the database and returns them as a JSON array. The `getBlog` function retrieves a single blog post by its ID. The `createBlog` function creates a new blog post with the specified title and content, and sets the creation date to the current time. The `updateBlog` function updates an existing blog post with the specified ID, replacing its title and content with the values from the request body. The `deleteBlog` function deletes an existing blog post with the specified ID.

#### To run the application, simply run `go run main.go` in your terminal. The server will start listening on port 8080. You can then use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send requests to the API.

# Note: This is a simple example meant for demonstration purposes only. In practice, you would want to add additional error handling and validation to ensure that your API is secure and reliable.
